<h3>Atrial Fibrillation Project
<hr>
</h3>
<p>In India the problem of where most of the resources are used for the fighting the communicable diseases, illness the atrial fibrillation is most frequently under-reported and not much focus is given to these disease. Another challenging fact that diseases like atrial fibrillation can cause silent death with no prior symptoms. India having highest number of diabetes cases, HTN, and high prevalence of COPD which all are risk factors of atrial fibrillation, still there is very little reporting of atrial fibrillation and very less is known regarding there the risk factors. Hence, we are conducting this survey to better understand the epidemiology and risk factors of atrial fibrillation in India.
  The study will be conducted in 2 phase. In the first data will be collected regarding the different risk factors and epidemiology.
  The patients who are newly diagnosed with the atrial fibrillation will be followed and different events will be collected at three, six, and 12 months.
</p>
